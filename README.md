# OpenSCAD Bezier Curves

A recursive implementation of bezier curves for OpenSCAD.

## Usage

### bezier::bezier_curve(control_points, fn)

A function that produces a set of points lying on the bezier curve defined
by a set of control points.

**Arguments**

- **control_points** `Array<Vector<Float>>` - The set of coordinates
    representing control points for the bezier curve. Providing 2 points
    results in a line, 3 points in a curve, and the more points the more
    complex the curve becomes.

- **fn** `Integer` - The number of line fragments to use when approximating
    the curve. This is similar to OpenSCAD's special `$fn` variable.

**Returns**

- `Array<Vector<Float>>` - A set of points lying on the bezier curve.

### bezier::bezier_point(control_points, t)

A function that samples a single point lying on the bezier curve defined by a
set of control points.

**Arguments**

- **control_points** `Array<Vector<Float>>` - See `bezier::bezier_curve`.

- **t** `Float` - A "time" value in the unit interval `[0, 1]`. This value
    controls how far along the curve the sampled point lays, although the
    points are not guaranteed to be sampled uniformly.

**Returns**

- `Vector<Float>` - A point lying on the bezier curve.

### preview::preview_bezier_curve(control_points, fn)

A module that renders a preview of a set of control points and the set of points
lying on the bezier curve defined by those control points. Points are rendered
as spheres and the lines between neighboring points are rendered as cylinders.

**Arguments**

- **control_points** `Array<Vector<Float>>` - See `bezier::bezier_curve`.

- **fn** `Integer` - See `bezier::bezier_curve`.

## TODO

- Provide modules for constructing `polyhedron` meshes.
- Investigate strategies for uniformly sampling curves.
- Investigate integrating a curve primitive into OpenSCAD.
